# morph-ml-sandbox
Make synthetic galaxy images and test ML classifiers/fitters on them, as practice for/benchmarking different methods. 

Files:
- `classifer.py`: types of morphology classifiers (CNN, Transformer)
- `dataset.py`: handles dataset loading for PyTorch
- `fitter.py`: Not implemented yet, will handle morphological fitting
- `train.py`: handles model training
- `utils.py`: TODO, but will hold common util functions
